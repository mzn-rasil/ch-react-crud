# ch-react-crud

## Introduction
This is a simple CRUD application made during my workshop program in [Code Himalaya](https://codehimalaya.com/). I was already familiar working in React, however
I learnt some React ecosystems that made development process even smoother. I used the following libraries: 
1. Typescript (Started implementing typescript from this project for type safety)
2. Axios (Earlier, used to implement fetch API for network requests)
3. Chakra UI (React Component Library for accessible and easier UI design)
4. React-Hook-Form (Performant library for working with forms and provides easy validation mechanisms)
5. Yup Resolver (Complementary with react-hook-form for validation purposes)
6. React Router v6 (Learnt new features like <Outlet /> and handling Protected routes)

## API used:
- [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to fetch /users.
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/d) for implementing authentication. 

## Possible extensions
Since the project was not planned out from the beginning, it does not have a specific path. Some of the extensions could be:
- Consuming /posts and displaying the individual user's posts when viewing them from the table.
- Similarly, we could use /todos.
